# Robofriends ü§ñ

Robofriends is a simple and fun React application that displays a list of robot friends. It fetches user data from an external API and allows you to filter the robots using a search bar. This project was created as part of my journey learning React and working with components, props, state, and API integration.

## üöÄ Features

- **Fetch Robots:** The app fetches robot data from an API and displays it on the main page.
- **Search Functionality:** A search bar filters the robots displayed based on the search input, making it easy to find specific robots.
- **Responsive UI:** The app is designed to work well on both desktop and mobile screens.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- React
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML/CSS
- [RoboHash API](https://robohash.org/) for robot images
- [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users) for user data
